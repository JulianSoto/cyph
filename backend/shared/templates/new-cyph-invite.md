The invite link above will walk you through creating a Cyph beta account. We highly recommend that
you do this from your desktop or laptop in a location where you have some privacy.

After signup, you'll have three options to securely message your friends:

1. New Burner Chat: Generates a one-time link to share with one person for a temporary short-lived
chat

2. Add Contact > External Contact: Sets up a long-lived chat with history saved in your account

3. Send them an invite code to make a full account and add them as a regular contact

Your {{#planFree}}account{{/planFree}}{{^planFree}}plan{{/planFree}} also includes:

{{#storageCap}}
* {{storageCap}} storage
{{/storageCap}}

{{#initialInvites}}
* {{initialInvites}} more invites to share with your friends
{{/initialInvites}}

you'd like

* Verification: You'll be first in line when we set up a "verified accounts" system like Twitter's

* Lifetime priority support: Email us any time at founders@cyph.com â€” or just add
