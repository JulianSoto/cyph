We highly recommend that you sign up from your desktop or laptop in a location where you have
some privacy. Afterwards, you'll have three options to securely message your friends:

1. **New Burner Chat:** Initiates a temporary short-lived chat with no history

2. **Add Contact > External Contact:** Long-lived chat with history saved in your account

3. **Add Contact > Invite to Cyph:** Spends an invite to let them create their own account
